**Inference for IV**

t-ration inference for IV. First-stage F and second stage T inference.

Relevant for possibly weak inference, anderson-rubin confidence intervals can be improved on from this paper. (Lee et al. 2022).

-   Tradeoffs between t and f

-   empirical practice

-   better CIs.

If first stage F is strong, we can use a 1.96 critical value for the 0.05 level, if the first stage is weaker then we eed to increase the critical value (e.g., 2.73).

**Simulated IV**

Collapse high-dimensional complicated policy schemes which can be made into a one dimensional instrument. Need to hold distribution of Xs fxed. 3333
